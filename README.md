# About the repos.
### This is NOT a file, nor a program but a WEBSITE


It's a small portfolio for me, I've made it for cool stuff. I can post stuffs like deving, scripting. I personally like html and lua.

print("hello this is just a silly website :3")

# Game 

* The game is a captcha inspired game where you have to do some steps to accept the terms of service, depicting how most websites asks you to read complete or manipulate with codes to accept the terms. This is a sarcasm proving how websites can be annoying when it comes to policies.

* Also I've made it to share it with my friends, meme it a little bite, just for fun.
* A silly experiment with HTML and limits :3
* Thanks to the captcha game for inspiring me!

This is just a silly little experiment that I will probably hate in the future and remove it lol :D
